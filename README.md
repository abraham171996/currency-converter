The Git repository contains a simple React application that allows users to convert currency amounts from one currency to another using the Frankfurter API. The application provides an input field for the user to enter the amount, and two select dropdowns to choose the source currency (`fromCur`) and the target currency (`toCur`). Upon selection, the converted currency amount is displayed below.

The `App` component manages the state of the amount, source currency, target currency, converted value, and loading status. It uses the `useState` hook to handle these states and the `useEffect` hook to trigger the currency conversion when any of the input values (`amount`, `fromCur`, `toCur`) change.

The currency conversion is performed using the Frankfurter API, which provides the latest exchange rates. When the user selects different currencies or changes the amount, the application fetches the exchange rate for the selected currencies from the API and calculates the converted amount. If the source and target currencies are the same, the converted amount is set to the same value as the input amount.

The application uses the `fetch` API to make asynchronous API calls to Frankfurter and uses `async/await` to handle the response. It then updates the `converted` state with the calculated converted amount.

The user interface is straightforward and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for converting currencies in real-time. Users can easily input the amount and select the desired currencies for conversion.

Developers can use this code as a starting point to build more complex currency conversion applications or integrate currency conversion features into larger projects. The repository showcases how to use React's state management and hooks to handle user input and perform API calls for currency conversion.
